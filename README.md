# Random-Search-Optimization-Techniques

This repository contains implementations of three different random search optimization techniques: Next Neighbor Algorithm, Generational Genetic Algorithm, and Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm.

## Next Neighbor Algorithm

The Next Neighbor Algorithm is a simple optimization technique that starts with an initial solution and looks at all neighboring solutions to find one that improves on the current solution. This process is repeated until no further improvements can be found. The Next Neighbor Algorithm is often used as a benchmark algorithm for more complex optimization techniques.

## Generational Genetic Algorithm

The Generational Genetic Algorithm is a popular optimization technique inspired by the process of natural selection. It works by generating a population of potential solutions, evaluating their fitness, and then selecting the best candidates to breed and produce a new generation of even better solutions. This process is repeated over multiple generations until a satisfactory solution is found.

## Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm

The Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm is an optimization technique based on the behavior of ant colonies. It involves simulating the behavior of ants as they search for food and communicate with each other using pheromones. The algorithm works by iteratively building and improving candidate solutions based on the collective pheromone trails left by the ants.
